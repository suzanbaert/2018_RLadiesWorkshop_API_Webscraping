# Webscraping Etiquette

1. If there is a public API available, use the API and don't scrape the info

2. Always check with `robotstxt` or `polite` whether you are allowed to scrape a page

3. Build system sleeps into your API or scraping requests

# API communication

Communication with HTTP request methods.
Two most common ones:

.pull-left[
## GET requests
Asking the API for something
```
library(httr)
response <- GET(url)
content(response)
```

]

.pull-right[
## POST requests
Given something to the API
```
library(httr)
response <- POST(url, body)
content(response)
```

]
