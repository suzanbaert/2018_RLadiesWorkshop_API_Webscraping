# Webscraping Etiquette

1. If there is a public API available, use the API and don't scrape the info

2. Always check with `robotstxt` or `polite` whether you are allowed to scrape a page

3. Build system sleeps into your API or scraping requests

4. Don't gather data you won't nee

5. Keep away from PII data (personal identifiable data)

# What is an API?

.center[API = Application Programming Interface  
"a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software"]

.center.handwritten[HUH ???]

### Examples:  
- Travel websites getting info on flight schedule and prices
- Getting fonts for your website (or this presentation) through Google Fonts API 
- Getting tweets with the hashtag #rstats via Twitter API
- ...

# API communication

Communication with HTTP request methods.
Two most common ones:

.pull-left[
## GET requests
Asking the API for something
```
library(httr)
response <- GET(url)
content(response)
```

]

.pull-right[
## POST requests
Given something to the API
```
library(httr)
response <- POST(url, body)
content(response)
```

]


---

# API output

Two general formats for API responses.
+ Both are plain text formats to exchange data
+ Most API's these days are JSON


.pull-left[
### JSON
Javascript Object Notation

```
{"employees":[
    { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
    { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
    { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
]}
```
]


.pull-right[
### XML
Extensible Markup Language

```
<employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
    </employee>
</employees>

# A quick intro to JSON

Two basic forms:
+ JSON object: `{"key": "value"}`
+ JSON array: `[1, 2, 3]` or `["a", "b", "c"]`

Building hierarchies
+ The value of a JSON object can be another JSON object or array
+ The values in a JSON array can be another JSON object or array

R users:
+ JSON object ~ named value
+ JSON array ~ named vector

---

# A quick intro to JSON

`jsonlite::prettify()` to make a more human readable JSON

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

json_object <- '{"organization" : "R-Ladies", "chapter": "Brussels", "start_year": 2017, "active": true, "organizers": ["Marlene", "Huong", "Suzan"]}'
prettify(json_object)
```


---

# A quick intro to JSON

`jsonlite::fromJSON()` to parse JSON to R


```{r}
library(jsonlite)

fromJSON(json_object)
```
